Portfolio Website (Basic HTML Project)
This is my very first project where I built a simple multi-page portfolio website using only basic HTML tags.
The website showcases my skills, education, and contact information along with an About Me and a Resume page.
It is designed as a clean, beginner-friendly static site to demonstrate my understanding of HTML structure and webpage linking.

ðŸ‘‰ Key Highlights:

Created multiple pages: Home, About, Contact, Resume.

Added sections for Skills, Education, Projects, and Interests.

Used basic HTML tags (<h1>, <ul>, <p>, <a>, etc.) without external frameworks.

Showcased personal details like name, skills, GitHub, LinkedIn, and LeetCode profiles.

First step in my journey toward Web Development.
