Portfolio Website (Basic HTML Project)
This is my very first project where I built a simple multi-page portfolio website using only basic HTML tags.
The website showcases my skills, education, and contact information along with an About Me and a Resume page.
It is designed as a clean, beginner-friendly static site to demonstrate my understanding of HTML structure and webpage linking.
